The Competitive TF2 Config

Installation instructions
Make sure you have .NET Framework v3.5 installed from: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx
Currently, the installer sucks dick. We should have a new version out soon but for now follow the manual install instructions.

Manual Install (recommended for now)

1) Reset your config folder to its default. BACK UP the entire folder first and then delete everything inside it except 'user.scr'. 
Now, run and exit the game (no need to join a server).
2) Copy over the contents of the cfg folder (from the installer) into your cfg folder.
3) Copy the hotkeys from 'hotkeys.txt' and paste them into your 'autoexec.cfg'. 
Now, run and exit the game. In your autoexec.cfg, delete the section you just copied so you can change hotkeys in the future. Done!
4) Please note, in observer mode, use the left and right arrows to switch perspectives. The script is compatible with FPS configs, just add them back in when done.
