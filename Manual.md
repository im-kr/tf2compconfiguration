Installing the script is as easy as dragging and dropping, then configuring with notepad.

  1. OPTIONAL if you're having problems: Reset your 'cfg' folder to its default. The cfg folder is located at 'C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\>USERNAME<\team fortress 2\tf\cfg'. Back up the folder and then delete everything inside it except 'user.scr'. Now, run and exit the game (no need to join a server).
  1. Copy over the contents of the cfg folder (from the archive) into your cfg folder.

Please note, in observer mode, use the left and right arrows to switch perspectives.

The script is compatible with FPS configs, just add them back in when done.
