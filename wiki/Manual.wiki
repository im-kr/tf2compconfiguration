#summary How to manually install the config.

The script is extremely easy to manually install:

     # Reset your 'cfg' folder to its default. The cfg folder is located at 'C:\Program Files\Steam\steamapps\>USERNAME<\team fortress 2\tf\cfg'. Back up the folder and then delete everything inside it except 'user.scr'. Now, run and exit the game (no need to join a server).
     # Copy over the contents of the cfg folder (from the archive) into your cfg folder.
     # Please note, in observer mode, use the left and right arrows to switch perspectives. The script is compatible with FPS configs, just add them back in when done.
