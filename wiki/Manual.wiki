#summary How to manually install the config.

Say the installer isn't working for you or you don't trust 3rd party exes (fair enough). The script is extremely easy to manually install:

     # Reset your config folder to its default. BACK UP the entire folder first and then delete everything inside it except 'user.scr'. Now, run and exit the game (no need to join a server).
     # Copy over the contents of the cfg folder (from the archive) into your cfg folder.
     # Please note, in observer mode, use the left and right arrows to switch perspectives. The script is compatible with FPS configs, just add them back in when done.
