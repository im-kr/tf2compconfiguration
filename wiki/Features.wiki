Feature List

 # All capable weapons will automatically reload. You can toggle autoreload on and off with keypad 0.
 # You can switch between alternate weapons (such as the kritzkrieg or backburner) with f1, f2, and f3 for primary, secondary and melee, respectively.
 # The script has some optomized net settings and hotkeys. Press keypad 2 for the default interp of 0.02. Press keypad 3 if you're getting loss (yellow) at 0.02. + and - can be used to adjust interp to your liking - it's what you're used to that counts. Yellow lerp is bad. Orange is OK.
 # If you choose to install the auto-fire pistol script, just hold down mouse1 to fire as fast as possible.
 # Says whenever you're ubering or switching between kritzkrieg and the medigun. There is also the option to enable autoheal without Valve's graphical glitches.
 # Includes a series of admin hotkeys for administering your server. Must press shift before using any hotkeys for fear of accidentally pressing them.
 # Pressing shift and a # key will switch you to that # class (press ',' in-game to see class #s).
 # Press 'B' down to forward spawn.
 # f7 toggles net_graph on and off.
 # f8 starts and stops a recording for those obnoxious invisible characters after an alt-tab.
 # Pressing 'q' will toggle between your primary and secondary weapons (look under optional binds in 'binds.txt' if you prefer default 'q' functionality).
 # f9 - f12 are server connection binds. Edit servers.cfg with your server connection and rcon information.
