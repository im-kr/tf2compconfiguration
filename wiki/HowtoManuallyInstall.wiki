#labels Phase-Deploy
Say the installer isn't working for you or you don't trust 3rd party exes (fair enough). The script is extremely easy to install manually:

     # Reset your config folder to its default. BACK UP the entire folder first and then delete everything inside it except 'user.scr'. Now, run and exit the game (no need to join a server).
     # Copy over the contents of the cfg folder (from the installer) into your cfg folder.
     # If you would like to change any of the default hotkeys, open your autoexec.cfg and do so. Reference 'binds.txt' for a complete list of game binds the script aliases before you rebind any hotkeys. Now, run and exit the game. In your autoexec.cfg, delete the section specified. Done!
     # Please note, in observer mode, use the left and right arrows to switch perspectives. The script is compatible with FPS configs, just add them back in when done.
