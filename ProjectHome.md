### Latest News ###
2.9 fixes the observer bug. You can now switch players in obs mode with mouse1 and mouse2. Unfortunately, it also removes autopistol and cycle\_spawn, so that you don't crash in servers with allow\_wait\_command "0" set (ESEA has this enabled on all match servers).

### What's it do? ###
The competitive configuration optimizes Team Fortress 2 for competitive play and tries to stay out of the way. Everything is either automatic or optional.

## Longterm objective ##
This project's intent is to provide a comprehensive configuration for Team Fortress 2 competitive play. The goal is to promote customization and growth within the community through convenience, rather than advantage, and do this in a way that is accessible for both experienced and novice FPS players. By taking feedback from leagues, we hope to keep the configuration legal in both North America and Europe.

## How To Contribute ##
