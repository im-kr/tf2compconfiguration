The Competitive TF2 Config

Installation instructions
Make sure you have .NET Framework v3.5 installed from: http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/netframework/default.aspx
Currently, the installer is bad. We should have a new version out soon but for now follow the manual install instructions.

Script Manual Install (recommended)

1) Reset your config folder to its default. BACK UP the entire folder first and then delete everything inside it except 'user.scr'. 
Now, run and exit the game (no need to join a server).
2) Copy over the contents of the cfg folder (from the installer) into your cfg folder.
3) If you would like to change any hotkeys on your own, do it inside competitive/binds.cfg or delete competitive/binds.cfg after you do it in game, since this will overwrite any binds the default install uses.
